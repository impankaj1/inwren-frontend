# Inwren Frontend

This repository is a Next.js application (App Router) that currently contains a single working page: the dashboard.

## Quickstart — run locally

These steps get the project running on your machine in under a minute.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/impankaj1/inwren-frontend.git
cd inwren-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Start the development server:

Note: the root `/` currently does not contain other pages — use `/dashboard` to view the dashboard UI.
